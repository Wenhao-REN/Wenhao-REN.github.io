excerpt: 'To develop a new composite material column for modern timber buildings and propose a reliable 
strengthening method for existing timber columns, wrapped carbon fiber reinforced polymer 
(CFRP) strips and near-surface mounted (NSM) steel bars reinforced timber columns were stud
ied. Five composite strengthened timber columns were designed, fabricated and tested under 
lateral cyclic loading. The experimental results showed that all specimens exhibited tensile 
rupture failure of the timber grain. The hysteretic curves showed that the proposed method could 
enhance the load-bearing capacity and deformation performance of the strengthened timber 
columns. With an increase in the number of CFRP strips, there was a marked improvement in the 
hysteretic performance of the specimens. Based on the experimental study, a finite element model 
of a composite strengthened timber column was developed using the OpenSees software appli
cation, the reliability of which was evident from the test results. A parametric study was then 
conducted to investigate the influence of the axial load, bar diameter, and the number and 
location of steel bars. This study aimed to provide a reference for seismic design and the practical 
application of the composite reinforcement method.   '
